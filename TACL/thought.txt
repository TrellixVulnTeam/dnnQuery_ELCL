Q & A:
what is template?
a set that contain all the hash tags like #Name #Country 

where could I get the template?
TO DO !!!

how to represent schema
see in the tagger

how to represent a <value> when it possibly indicate several different field (another machine learning problem: coreference resolution):
combination of their word vector

the difference between a number representation and a binary vector representation:
number could tolerate an increase of classes, while the size of classes for binary representation is fixed.

meaning of field_template:
capability to add entity complexity into the NLI. e.g. (city, population…); (employee, age…)

necessity of value_embed:
completely unnecessary if we combined with Pointer Network

**************************************
Pipeline: ——— Contribution Pipeline
1 first put convert schema into template representation
convert the current logical forms to new forms with <field>
2 tag each word in the input with corresponding item (tag with <field: id> and build dicts for <field:id>: template, <value:id>: words for the use of decoding, could be another function outside NN, before DBMS)
3 During training it’s relatively simple: (tagged_query, new logical forms); during accuracy evaluation, convert new logical forms back to old logical forms and verify the accuracy. 

**************************************
1 Generate more data: take Wikitable questions and categorized by logical forms (and schema), augment to more data (it would be best if we have a factor of 10~100X than current data) ——— contribution Dataset, data augmentation (later study GAN)

3 Learning model for current value-field correspondence ——— contribution Tagging model

2 Evaluate on other dataset

4 bloom filter which is able to check even similar words (for values, and field too if enabled)

5 optimization: beam search, hyper parameter control, LSTM
